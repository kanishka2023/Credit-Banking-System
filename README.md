# Credit-Banking-System

This is my very first project as an interned candidate at **Edulyt India** for the role as Data Analyst.
The project consisted of 3 tables very first of which included 100 Customers and their informations like Age, Company, Credit Card Product, Credit Limit, Segment and City.
Processes performed were like Analyzing customers, their segments, spend and repayment amount and using pivoting concept to calculate various required values. At first, Sanity checks were to be performed which includes age manipulation and calculating profits by Credit and Intrest. Insights were obtained by calculating profits on basis of credit and intrest rates by merging several tables.
